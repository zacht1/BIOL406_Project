### Data Collection Methodology
Data collection focused on how the presence of either invasive species affected soil acidity as well as species compositions and percentage covers in both forest types. Coniferous data were gathered along the Douglas Fir trail leading to the Council trail, and deciduous data were collected along the Camosun trail near Pacific Spirit Park in Vancouver, BC. Data collection followed a pairwise approach: invaded plots were established by venturing a certain depth/distance into the forest until the target invasive species was encountered, and corresponding control plots were identified by moving parallel to the trail, reaching a similar forest depth where the invasive species was absent. Quadrat-based sampling was conducted across 8 total sites, with 4 invaded plots (2 coniferous, 2 deciduous) and 4 control plots (2 coniferous, 2 deciduous). Soil samples were taken right by the invasive species plant (sample 1), 0.5m away (sample 2) and 2m away (sample 3) about 2-3 inches deep in invaded plots, and 3 measurements were taken from uninvaded plots approximately at the center (sample 2) and 2m in either direction (samples 1 and 3). Species cover and identities were determined by referring to a plant identifier app when unknown or simply the provided species identification guide, and individual estimates were refined through consensus until a reliable value was reached collectively; additionally, qualitative covariates such as canopy cover, estimated percentage of sunlight, presence of other invasive species and slope differences, and soil moisture were recorded comparatively for plots. This study aims to examine whether sites invaded by English ivy or English holly show considerable differences in soil pH compared to the uninvaded areas and whether their presence leads to lower Shannon diversity due to competitive exclusion. It also explores how these differences vary between deciduous and coniferous forests. 
The soil samples for English Holly 1 and 2, English Ivy 1 and 2 invaded plot and control plots at the Douglas Fir trail leading to Council Trail were taken on Thursday, March 6th, at 12-3:30 p.m., pH tests were conducted on Wednesday, March 12th at 10:30 p.m for Ivy 2, while the remainder were done the following day, March 13th at 11 a.m. The soil samples for English Holly 4 invaded plot, and its control plot along the Camosun trail were taken Tuesday, March 11th at 2:30 p.m., pH tests were conducted on Wednesday, March 12th at 10:30 p.m. The soil samples for English Holly 3, Ivy 3 and 4 and the corresponding control plots along the Camosun trail were taken Sunday at 4:00 p.m., pH tests were conducted on Thursday, March 13th, at 11 a.m. 

### Repository Contents:

##### Scripts Folder
1. **data_cleaning.R** : R script for the cleaning, formatting and summarisation of the raw field data. This script imports the raw data file (raw_site_data.csv), re-formats it for easier use, calculates some summary statistics and indices for further analysis and writes the resulting data to file (see below).

##### Data Folder
1. **raw_site_data.csv** : raw data collected in the field. Data contains 28 columns; Plot, Forest Type, Percent cover for species (columns 3-23), Canopy Cover (%), Sample 1-3 pH, Site Characteristics.
